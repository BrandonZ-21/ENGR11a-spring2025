                        <center><img class="center" src="assets/NameTag/NameTagFirst.jpg" style="width:600px;height:300px;"></center>
                        <p style="text-indent:30px;">After seeing the result of the name tag I think the overall process went smoothly for my first print. I did run into a few errors and minor problems during the printing mostly because I was unfamiliar with the software and machines. So first I downloaded the file for the name tag, then I opened the file in Prusa Slicer. But when it loaded it was inverted, I wasn’t sure why it happened but I just had to restart the process and it was fine after. The length of the name tag was 73mm, the width was 20mm, and the height was 3mm. After finalizing my CAD I sliced it which turned it to a CAM. I transferred the file into a USB and plugged it into a 3D printer.</p>
                        <center><img class="center" src="assets/NameTag/NameTagPrinting.jpg" style="width:400px;height:300px;"></center>
                        <p style="text-indent:30px;">Before printing the name tag I noticed that the previous filament was not going to be enough. So I had to change the filament. I had to go to “replace filament” on the 3D printer and it will push filament out so I can put a new one in. A tip I learned on the way was to cut the new filament so it has a point on the tip before I put it in. After that it will automatically push the filament into the filament sensor, but I noticed that it didn’t push it all the way through the Extruder-Print head PTFE tube so I had keep telling the printer to continue pushing filament until it started to coming out of the nozzle.</p>
                        <center><img class="center" src="assets/NameTag/NameTagLayer.jpg" style="width:450px;height:450px;"></center>
                        <p style="text-indent:30px;">While printing, I saw in the direction that we had to change the color of the filament half way into the print. I thought that we had to manually pause the printer at 50% but it would automatically stop to tell me to change the filament so I changed it twice during this print. You can see the photo of the name tag, it has a layer of gold in the middle.</p>
                        <p style="text-indent:30px;">In total it took around 13 mins and it used around 4g of filament. Some trouble shooting I noticed were a little layer separation on the top right corner, it sort of melted into the print and there were a few gaps in the infill lines and gaps in the lettering. The only gaps that should be in the letters were at the bottom of the letter a, but there were gaps in the B, N, D, O, Z, and H. Overall, The most challenging physically was changing the filament and making sure it got to the nozzle. Also using the software took some time to get used too and learn how to use it.</p>

                        <center><img class="center" src="assets/GoingMerry/GoingMerryFront.jpg" style="width:300px;height:300px;"></center>
                        <p style="text-indent:30px;">For my second print I wanted to print out the boat from One Piece called the Going Merry. I thought that this print would push the printer to its limits. This is my second time printing so using the Prusa Slicer software went smoothly. I didn’t change any settings for the printer. I only scale the print to 50%. After slicing it the software gave me a warning about the stability of the object, it said it was unstable. I did notice that some parts of the print did not start from the base so sometimes the printer would print in air which I predicted would be one of the factors that would make the print fail. If the print didn’t fail it would have taken 1 hr 38 min and it would use 21.31g of filament. </p>
                        <center><img class="center" src="assets/GoingMerry/GoingMerrySide.jpg" style="width:300px;height:300px;"></center>
                        <p style="text-indent:30px;"> In the beginning during the print it was printing smoothly, but I think towards the middle the base of the boat didn’t stick the bed very well and ended up putting building up filament in one place. I believe if I were to reprint this object I would add structures to the base and under parts where it did not touch the base so this will stabilize the print. The only trouble shooting I noticed were some minor blobs and zits on the base of the boat, but the print went pretty well until it didn’t slick to the bed where it tipped over. </p>

                        <p style="text-indent:30px;">Overall, I thought that my first 3D Printing process went out very smoothly. During the printing process I did run into some trouble and mistakes but I have learned from it through the experience. Next time I 3D print I will use the skillsI learned in this project to print out more things and less mistakes and failures.</p>

                        <img class="center" src="assets/BoatScene/BoatScene360.PNG" style="width:300px;height:300px;">
                        <img class="center" src="assets/BoatScene/BSSketch.jpg" style="width:400px;height:300px;">
                        <p style="text-indent:30px;">For my third print I was tasked to add anything to an existing print using Tinkercad. So I chose to add things to the 3D Benchy boat. I wanted to make a small diorama for the boat. During my sketch I wanted a nice base that could stick to the bed of the 3D printer well and then I wanted to make another surface for the boat to make it look like water. Finally to add some action I sketched out shark fins around the boat.</p>
                        <center><img class="center" src="assets/BoatScene/BSTink.PNG" style="width:400px;height:200px;"></center>
                        <p style="text-indent:30px;">Now I have to design it in Tinkercad. My first thought on Tinkcad was that it was very user friendly and I picked up the skills in using it very quickly. It also had 3d shapes and other figures ready for you to choose. So for the base I used a cylinder to make the base, as for the water surface I tried to use a dome shape but it didn’t look natural so instead I switched to a sphere. I flattened the sphere onto the cylinder which gave the edges a gap which made it look more realistic. As for the shark fins I used cones and flattened them on the sides. Afterwards, I was exploring the selections of shapes Tinkercad already made and I found that they had figures of people and I wanted to add it into my diorama. So I made the person float on the surface by adding a donut shaped circle around the person. When I finished my design I checked to see if they were all connected to each other, which they were. Then I downloaded it into a STL file which I put into Prusa Slicer. It came out pretty big so I scaled it down to 75%. The print time was 1hr 14min, using 22.62g of filament.</p>
                        <center><img class="center" src="assets/BoatScene/BSPrint.jpg" style="width:300px;height:400px;"></center>
                        <p style="text-indent:30px;">When the print came out, it was almost perfect. I noticed that the sphere that mimics the ocean was off centered from the base and I don’t think the base was a perfect circle. In Tinkercad it did look like a circle but I guess it was hard to tell. Some minor troubleshoots that I noticed was that the bow had some warping, there was also a little layer separation between one of the fins and the water, and lastly there was some minor stringing. Overall, the print turned out very good.</p>

                        <img class="center" src="assets/BoatOcean/BOSketch.jpg" style="width:500px;height:300px;">
                        <p style="text-indent:30px;">For my fourth print I wanted to make the water the action, so I started with a huge wave for my sketch. Keeping it simple because I am using Fusion for the first time I wanted to focus on designing the wave. I will just add a few boats on the wave after. The first time opening Fusion I was hit with a lot of functions each with different jobs. I had to watch a few tutorials and youtube videos to find the functions that would help me design a wave.</p>
                        <center><img class="center" src="assets/BoatOcean/BOFusion.PNG" style="width:500px;height:300px;"></center>
                        <p style="text-indent:30px;">First I went to Create Sketch, then it popped out different types of lines. The one I chose was Fit Point Spline which creates a curve line when you put down a point. I realized that putting more points would make it more flexible and the closer the point is to one another the straighter the line will be. After making a 2D sketch of the wave I wanted to make it into a 3D shape. The term for that is called extruding. After that I added a few boats on the wave. To insert it into Fusion I have to make it into a mesh then I can turn it into a solid. I wanted to put it at different angles just to see how it would print out.</p>
                        <center><img class="center" src="assets/BoatOcean/BOPrint.jpg" style="width:300px;height:300px;"></center>
                        <p style="text-indent:30px;">I downloaded the file onto Prusa Slicer. It was way bigger than the bed so I had to scale it down to 15%. Because of the overhang of the wave I had to add supports to it. I was recommended organic supports, I changed the settings of the supports to 50° for overhang threshold and the branch diameter was 1mm.</p>
                        <center><img class="center" src="assets/BoatOcean/BO360.PNG" style="width:500px;height:200px;"></center>
                        <p style="text-indent:30px;">When the print came out it had a lot of stringing between the boats. There were also small features that did not print out for the boats. They were boat shaped but it did not have all the details of the benchy boat. As for the wave it was pretty good but there was minor warping and blobs. Overall, my design from Fusion turned out pretty good. Next time I would want to size up the boats a little bit bigger so it would be much easier for it to print out the details of the boats. Or instead of adding the supports everywhere I could have selected the supports only touching the bed because there were some supports that were for the boats which I think was also a factor of the boats not being able to print out well.</p>

                        <p style="text-indent:30px;"> From this project I learned how to add to designs using Tinkercad and Fusion. At first I liked how Tinkercad was very user friendly and had many different shapes prepared for you to use. Then after learning about Fusion I thought that Fusion was way more powerful but it took some time to learn about some of the features it had. I haven’t fully grasped the full functionality of Fusion yet but I believe that I will go to this software when I want to design a print.</p>
